    "In order to use Python and the notebooks we recommend you to either:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a text editor or IDE (Windows):\n",
    "1. [Install Python through the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n",
    "2. **On the installation menu press \"Add to PATH**. Adding Python to path allows you to simply write `python script.py` instead of `c:/YOUR/PATH/TO/Python script.py`\n",
    "3.  Install a text editor or IDE that has support for notebooks such as [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [juptyer lab](https://jupyter.org/install)\n",
    "4.  For Visual studio code: [install the python plug-in](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and the [jupyter notebook plug-in](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Python (Linux):\n",
    "1. Distribution specific: https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/ (make sure you pick Python 3.11)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Colab (easier):\n",
    "1. Unzip the folder.\n",
    "2. Add the folder to your personal Google Drive. \n",
    "3. Open the .ipynb file in Google Drive. \n",
    "4. Add the following snippet to the top of the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from google.colab import drive\n",
    "drive.mount('/content/drive')\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Add this line of code to make the folder where the .ipynb file is your working directory  ```%cd /content/drive/My\\ Drive/YOUR FOLDER NAMES HERE``` \n",
    "2. Colab comes with most packages we'll be using preinstalled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most importantly: Don't be ashamed to let us know if you're having trouble getting it to work. You're definitely not the only person struggling with this. Try this as soon as possible after the first lab and let us know if you're stuck.**"

    "#### The key idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments are a key part of any Python workflow. If you have not started using them now is a good time to start.\n",
    "When you install packages without a virtual environment they are added to a your \"system\" Python's. That is problematic for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is not uncommon to have multiple projects require the same package under a different version. \n",
    "2. If you install a new package it might update an existing package with a breaking change.\n",
    "3. (Extra) It is easier to version control your project's dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The command `python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment` creates a virtual environment. Two things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Virtual environments can have a name, in the example above it's called `venv` which will create a `.venv` directory.\n",
    "2. You can pick any target directory for your virtual environment or even leave it blank. TIP: Create it in the root of your (Python) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activating a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to run the right command in your terminal (CTRL+J for those using visual studio code). Afterwards you should see the name of your virtual environment in front of your working  directory. The following commands, copied verbatim from https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html, let you activate a virtual environment. The `<venv>` is a path to your virtual environment.\n",
