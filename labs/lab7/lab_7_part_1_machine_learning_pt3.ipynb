For example, after one-hot encoding categorical variables like 'Country' and 'Destination', we can generate interaction terms to explore the combined effect of these two features.\n",

Each of these new columns will have a value of 1 only if both contributing variables (e.g., 'City' is 'New York' AND 'Country' is 'USA') are 1; otherwise, the value will be 0. This new variable thus answers the question: \"Is the traveler from X city AND going to Y country?\"\n",

Binning would let us model this non-linear relationship. Instead of treating temperature as a single continuous predictor with a constant effect, we could divide temperatures into ranges (e.g., 0-10°C, 10-20°C, 20-30°C, etc.) and treat each range as a separate category. By one hot encoding these categories, we enable our model to capture the varying effects of different temperature ranges on people's comfort levels. This approach can reveal more complex patterns in how the predictor variable (in this case, temperature) influences the outcome variable (such as people's reported happiness)."
