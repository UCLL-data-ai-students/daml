    "### Interpretation of correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab lecture there was a bit of discussion of how interpret correlations. The previous lab said a correlation of 0.75 could be interpreted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If variable A increases with 1 unit variable B increases with 0.75 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "**That is usually incorrect.** \n",
    "\n",
    "The (sample) correlation $r_{X,Y}$ is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_{x,y} = \\frac{cov(x,y)}{(n-1)s_{x}s_{y}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_{i} - \\bar{x})(y_{i} - \\bar{y})}}{(n-1)s_{x}s_{y}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have some notation to unpack here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two variables $x$ and $y$. These each have a mean $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ pronounced as x bar and y bar respectively, $s_{x}$ and $s_{y}$ are respectively the standard deviations of x and y.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first equality shows us that the correlation $r_{x, y}$ is a normalized version of something called the covariance (cov). The scaling is achieved by dividing by a factor related to the product of the standard deviations of the two variables. This is what ensures that $r_{x,y} \\in [-1, 1]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thee covariance expresses the joint variability of two variables. A covariance of 8 means that if variable x increased by 1 the other variable increases by an amount that is dependent on the units and scale of both variables; it doesn't specify a fixed number of units either.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the correct interpretation of a correlation coefficient is: \n",
    "\n",
    "> A correlation coefficient, measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, but not the slope of that relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to know how much one variable varies in function of the other we can look at the regression slope:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\beta_{y} = r_{x,y}\\frac{s_{x}}{s_{y}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope of the regression has a deep connection with the correlation. It's the correlation weighted by the proportion of the standard deviations. Logically, if $s_{x} = s_{y}$ the interpretation given last lecture holds. Generally that is not the case, so those that made this remark last lecture were correct. The equation above shows that it is trivial to recover the slope from the correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that correlations and the slope of a regression are expressing linear relationships. As discussed last lecture Anscombe's quartet consists of four datasets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statistics, yet have very different distributions and appear very different when graphed. **This highlights the importance of visualizing data and not relying solely on statistical metrics.**"

    "\n",
    "1. **Exploratory Phase (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: \n",
    "   - **What it is**: At this stage, we're diving into the data, much like a researcher in a lab. We're experimenting, testing hypotheses, and analyzing patterns. It's a phase of discovery, and sometimes it gets technical and intricate.\n",
    "   - **Who it's for**: Primarily for those who are closely working with the data, like data scientists and analysts. It's about understanding, not necessarily communicating.\n",
    "   - **Visuals**: Charts and graphs here can be detailed and complex because they serve as tools for understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Presentation Phase (Explanatory Data Visualization)**: \n",
    "   - **What it is**: Once we've gained insights from our exploration, it's time to share them. Think of this as distilling our findings into a clear message or story.\n",
    "   - **Who it's for**: A wider audience, which could include stakeholders, team members, or anyone who needs to understand the main takeaways.\n",
    "   - **Visuals**: Here, simplicity and clarity take the front seat. The visuals are designed to be understood quickly and should align with the principles of clarity, simplicity, accuracy, and relevance.\n",

At the end of the day, it is fully built on top of Matplotlib so everything we have learn about customization still holds.

    "\n",
    "**When is Color-Coding Useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Limited Categories**: Color-coding works best when the number of categories is limited. If there are too many categories, the plot can become cluttered and colors hard to distinguish.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overlapping Data Points**: If you're interested in seeing where data points from different categories intersect or overlap, using color on a single plot can be very effective.\n",
